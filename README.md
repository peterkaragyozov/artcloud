# ArtCloud

ArtCloud is a place where users can share their favourite pieces of art. 

Users which do not have a profile yet or haven't signed into the website, are able to see content on it, but with limited functionality. 

Signed in users:
* have their own profiles where they can upload their own profile picture;
* have full CRUD functionality on their own pieces of art;
* are able to leave comments and likes on other users' posted art pieces;
* are able to see other users' profiles alongside the art pieces they have posted.
