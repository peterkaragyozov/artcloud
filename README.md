# Artcloud
 This is a Python Web Framework Project called ArtCloud. 
 
1.ArtCloud is a place where users can sign up / sign in and share their favourite pieces of art. 
2.Users, which do not have a profile yet or haven't signed in, are also able to see content in the website, but with limited functionality. 
3.Signed in users have their own profiles, in which they have a default profile picture. Should they request to have a different profile picture, they can at any time upload one of their own. They are also able to comment and like other user's posted art pieces.
